Note: In a production environment, you should replace the placeholder references with actual images.

For this demonstration, the site is using CSS backgrounds with placeholders.

In production:
1. Replace all image references in the code with actual image files
2. Consider using Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
3. Add proper alt text for accessibility

Suggested image sizes:
- Hero background: 1920x1080px
- About image: 600x450px
- Product images: 600x400px
- Technology image: 500x700px
