# 3D Model Placeholders

This directory would contain the 3D models (.glb files) for the drones:

- damisa.glb
- argini.glb
- arsenio.glb
- xander.glb
- bfly.glb

For production, these would be actual 3D models of the respective drones created in a 3D modeling software like Blender, and exported in glTF/GLB format, which is optimal for web-based 3D rendering.

The current implementation handles cases where models might be missing by displaying a placeholder cube.
